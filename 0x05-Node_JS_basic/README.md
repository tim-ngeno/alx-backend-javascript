# Node.js

#### Getting Started
Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling server-side scripting.

- **Install Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from the official website [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **Verify Installation**: Confirm that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are properly installed by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.

#### Using Node.js
Node.js provides a wide range of functionalities for server-side development:

- **Run JavaScript**: Execute JavaScript files using Node.js by running `node filename.js`.
- **Use Node.js Modules**: Leverage the built-in modules and third-party packages available through npm to extend the functionality of your applications.
- **Read Files**: Utilize specific Node.js modules like `fs` (File System) to read files in your application.

#### Process API
The Process API in Node.js allows you to access various information about the current process, environment, and command-line arguments.

- **Access Command Line Arguments**: Retrieve command-line arguments using `process.argv`.
- **Environment Variables**: Access environment variables using `process.env`.

#### Child Process
Node.js provides the `child_process` module, which allows you to spawn child processes, execute other binaries, and communicate with them.

### Express.js

#### Getting Started
Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.

- **Install Express**: Install Express.js using npm by running `npm install express`.
- **Basic Server Setup**: Create a basic HTTP server using Express.js to handle requests and responses.

#### Advanced Express.js
Express.js offers advanced features for building scalable and maintainable web applications:

- **Advanced Routing**: Define complex routes with Express.js to handle different HTTP methods and route parameters.
- **Middleware**: Implement middleware functions to execute code at various points during the request-response cycle.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully using middleware functions in Express.js.

#### Using ES6 with Node.js
You can leverage modern JavaScript features by using ES6 syntax in your Node.js applications.

- **Babel Integration**: Use Babel to transpile ES6 code into compatible JavaScript that Node.js can execute.
- **Setup**: Install Babel and configure it in your Node.js project to start using ES6 features.

#### Development Tools

- **Nodemon**: Enhance your development workflow with Nodemon, which automatically restarts the Node.js application when changes are detected in the source code.

### Testing

#### Mocha Documentation
Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.

- **Install Mocha**: Install Mocha globally using npm by running `npm install -g mocha`.
- **Writing Tests**: Create test suites and test cases using Mocha's expressive API.
- **Running Tests**: Execute your tests by running `mocha` in the terminal.
