## Introduction

ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced the concept of classes to JavaScript, providing a more structured and syntactic way to create objects. Classes are a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods.

This guide covers the essentials of working with ES6 classes, including class definition, method creation, static methods, class extension, and a brief introduction to metaprogramming using symbols.

## Defining a Class

In ES6, you can define a class using the `class` keyword. Here's a basic example:

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  // Methods can be added to the class
  eat() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is eating.`);
  }
}
```

## Adding Methods to a Class

Methods can be added to a class using the class's prototype. Here's how you can add a method to the `Animal` class:

```javascript
class Animal {
  // ...constructor

  eat() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is eating.`);
  }

  // New method added
  sleep() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is sleeping.`);
  }
}
```

## Static Methods

Static methods are methods that are called on the class itself, rather than on an instance of the class. They are defined using the `static` keyword. Here's an example:

```javascript
class MathOperations {
  static add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}

// Usage
const sum = MathOperations.add(5, 3);
console.log(sum); // Output: 8
```

## Extending a Class

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This is achieved using the `extends` keyword. Here's an example:

```javascript
class Dog extends Animal {
  // Additional properties/methods can be added
  bark() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is barking.`);
  }
}

// Usage
const myDog = new Dog('Buddy');
myDog.eat();  // Inherited method
myDog.bark(); // Extended method
```

## Metaprogramming and Symbols

Symbols are a new primitive type introduced in ES6, and they can be used for metaprogramming â€“ writing code that manipulates the behavior of existing code. Symbols are often used as unique identifiers for object properties. Here's a brief example:

```javascript
const key = Symbol('myKey');

class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    this[key] = 'Some value';
  }

  getValue() {
    return this[key];
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

ES6 classes provide a cleaner and more object-oriented syntax for creating and working with objects in JavaScript. This guide covered the basics of class definition, adding methods, static methods, class extension, and a brief introduction to metaprogramming using symbols.
